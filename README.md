**DroidNode** is a lightweight runtime on Android. It API-enables low-level mobile control capabilities via wireless debugging (ADB over Wi-Fi), turning a phone into an automation node that can be remotely controlled through standard HTTP requests.

Unlike traditional automation frameworks, DroidNode focuses on the **infrastructure layer**. It is not tied to any specific AI model or workflow, and provides stable, standardized primitive operation APIs for LLM/VLM agents, automation testing, and remote device management.

⚠️ Disclaimer & Security Warning

**This project is currently in an AI PoC stage and has not been production-hardened or security-hardened.**

* **No authentication**: the current version does not enforce token verification, and any reachable host in the same LAN may control the device.
* **Public network risk**: never expose the API port directly to the public internet.
* **Legal responsibility**: users must ensure usage complies with local laws and platform policies. The authors are not liable for any loss caused by abuse.


## 🚀 Core Features

* **Fully embedded ADB communication**: inspired by Shizuku, uses `mDNS` for automatic endpoint discovery and supports completing wireless pairing and connection directly on-device, without relying on external PC-side runtime during operation.
* **Embedded API Server**: built on Ktor, listening on port `17171` by default.
* **Primitive controls**: standardized APIs for click, swipe, text input, UI tree capture (XML), and screenshots.
* **Native input enhancement**: built-in `ActlImeService` IME supports UTF-8 injection and improves remote input reliability for focus/text scenarios.
* **Modular architecture**: APIs are registered in a plugin-like modular way, making custom capability extension straightforward.

## 🛠 Quick Start

### 1. Environment

* Android 11+ (wireless debugging required).
* Phone and controller must be on the same Wi-Fi network.

### 2. Build and Install

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/droidnode.git
cd droidnode

# Build with local Gradle
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug

# Install to device
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

```

### 3. Activate Node

1. Launch **DroidNode App** on the phone.
2. Go to Developer Options -> Wireless debugging -> Pair device with pairing code.
3. Enter the pairing code in the DroidNode notification action to complete local ADB authorization.
4. Tap **Start API Server**.

## 🔌 Clients (External Addons)

`clients/` is the workspace for external tooling built on top of DroidNode APIs.  
These tools are optional clients, not part of the Android node runtime itself.

Current demo: [`clients/llm-controller`](./clients/llm-controller/README.md)

Controller principles:

* **API-driven closed loop**: repeatedly captures screen via `/v1/ui/screenshot`, decides next action, then executes control APIs.
* **Adaptive grid planning**: each screenshot is partitioned into an `m*n` grid (`m,n >= 3`) with near-square cells and minimal total cells.
* **Two-stage localization**:
  * Stage-1 model outputs action + target + region(s).
  * Stage-2 model predicts normalized offsets inside the selected crop, then maps back to absolute screen coordinates.
* **Multi-region merge**: if a target spans multiple regions, regions are expanded to a minimal covering rectangle and cropped once for Stage-2.
* **Persistent memory**: step events are stored in SQLite for short-term task context and replay/debug analysis.
